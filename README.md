Hi, I’m Mark Schofield. I teach chemistry at The George Washington University which, when founded in 1821 by Congress (along with American University, Gallaudet University, Georgetown University, Howard University) was the only congressionally chartered universities in the United States. I’m interested in developing computational chemistry tools (python scripts especially) for teaching and research. I’m currently [re]learning python to execute and manage Quantum Espresso and Gaussian calculations. I can be reached at mschofie AT gwu.edu
